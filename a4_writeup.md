# Assignment 4 - Writeup

In assignment 4 we created a basic tic tac toe game so that we could learn object oriented programming. Respond to the following questions.

## Reflection Questions

1. What was the most difficult part to tic-tac-toe?
Finding the shortest way to find if a player has won or lost.
2. Explain how you would add a computer player to the game.
I would create a Ai That could read the board and choose a open * that would blokck the user and would give him a chance to win.
3. If you add a computer player, explain (doesn't have to be super technical) how you might get the computer player to play the best move every time. *Note - I am not grading this for a correct answer, I just want to know your thoughts on how you might accomplish it.

It doesnt need to be super technicl it would just need to be able to check the board for already placed things then be able to pick something open.
